You forgot to say that the left wants to use lockdowns to combat c19 knowing full well that that strategy would destroy the economy and drive it into a deep recession or worse, all for their political gain. You forgot to say that the left is already working to further scare and divide the American ppl by going on national tv and telling the ppl not to trust the CDC and the FDA on the safety of c19 vaccines. You forgot to say the govt has already set plans in motion and recruited CVS and Walgreens as well as military logistics to deliver c19 vaccines to the ppl, and instead, the left has gone on national tv to say just the opposite."

I doubt we get a strong move to the upside today. We&#39;ll most likely re-test that 41.7 level. If we break 41.7 with volume my target exit will be around 40.5."

&quot;To showcase how utterly exaggerated the current sentiment is regarding the company‚Äôs future EVA growth potential, we ran an enterprising scenario through our discounted EVA model, assuming an Intel-like 10% EVA Margin coupled with an EVA growth of 15% annually for the next 10 years.

Bearish,"The S&amp;P 500 will likely fall 10% in the near term before the bull market resumes, said Morgan Stanley&#39;s Mike Wilson on Monday. 

The investment chief said the benchmark&#39;s failed attempt to break through 3,550 last week signals that its correction that began in September is not over yet. 

Wilson added that the lack of fiscal stimulus, uncertainty around the election, and a second wave of coronavirus are headwinds to near-term stock gains. 

Investors should reallocate their portfolios with stocks that hinge on the economic reopening, he said.

Bearish,"The S&amp;P 500 will likely see a 10% correction in the near term before the bull market continues, according to Morgan Stanley&#39;s chief investment officer. 
&quot;With so many uncertainties over the next month, we think another 10% correction from Monday&#39;s highs is the most likely outcome in the near term before this bull market can resume,&quot; Mike Wilson wrote in a Monday note.
The benchmark index saw its first 10% correction in the new bull market in September. After breaking 3,500, it quickly retreated 10%, explained Wilson. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 attempted to break through 3,550 again, but failed, a sign that Wilson said demonstrates that the correction that began in September is not over.
Wilson added that the S&amp;P 500&#39;s attempted breakthrough last week &quot;occured on less momentum&quot; than in September, which suggests that there is more downside to come before the bull market can resume.

To have a chance at justifying its valuation, Tesla will need to dominate the auto industry but Musk said achieving its 2020 goal of 500,000 global vehicle deliveries &quot;has become more difficult&quot;. 
Updates on several past proclamations about new products were also absent or vague. Musk didn&#39;t provide a production timeline for the semi truck or 2nd-generation Roadster, products unveiled in 2017.

5. Cloud web services competition has skyrocketed with so many new cloud businesses that entered the game

Goldman has agreed to pay about $2.8 billion to the U.S. Justice Department and other global regulators to settle 1MDB allegations, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. That is on top of the $2.5 billion it agreed in July to pay the government of Malaysia. The penalties amount to about eight months of profits for the Wall Street firm.

In Brooklyn federal court on Thursday, a Goldman subsidiary in Malaysia said it would plead guilty to conspiring to violate U.S. antibribery laws. The bank is expected later Thursday to finalize its settlement with the Justice Department and regulators in the U.K., Singapore and New York state.

He concluded by saying that debt is 1.8x EBITDA, down from 4.7x just 2.5 years ago, so it&#39;s no longer an issue, and their FCF allows them to continue paying it down and also pay a dividend, which they subsequently announced a few days ago.

The key question for the quarter: Whether American banks would show that they‚Äôre largely done setting aside money for loan defaults tied to the pandemic. That appears to be the case at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, which had a $611 million provision in credit costs in the period, compared with $10.5 billion in the previous quarter.

Rather than building loan-loss reserves, as it had done aggressively in the first half of the year, JPMorgan actually reduced them by $569 million in the quarter, citing a runoff in its mortgage portfolio. The bank had added more than $15 billion to loan loss reserves in the first two quarters of 2020."

Definitely also looking for LVS earnings on Wednesday (10/21) ... hearing that Las Vegas is doing really bad with many restaurants and stores closed along the Strip and preparing to file for BK in the coming weeks ... and btw we live here. The type of visitors to Las Vegas has fallen off a cliff with street fights and shootings along the Strip ... hotel rooms at only a few bucks (like Flamingo at $23/night on the weekend plus resort fee).

Bullish,"$UVV Cheap high yielding dividend champion trading at 80% of shareholder&#39;s equity, below fair value RSI, 14PE, bottom of strong upward channel. Aggressive dividend growth recently from a company that&#39;s older than the dirt its product is grown on. Company hasn&#39;t seen much growth recently so I sort of see it like a $T that&#39;ll spit off a stable, modestly-growing dividend which I can put in other things. Reason it&#39;s better than $T though is there&#39;s still a lot more room for capital appreciation given the value it&#39;s currently trading at. 

Also just a random thought but it would be really interesting to me if these guys could pivot with the land/machinery/building assets they&#39;ve got to move into mj. This seems to be the way that big tobacco is moving into the future in order to combat the shrinkage of the industry, along with vaping (see $MO). These guys have the farming background/experience. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there&#39;s internal talks of such things."

They already stocked Dodgers gear in store and a few online. Also cooler than normal Southern California winter forecast works in favor of the company for Q4. Could be the perfect storm for BGFV - I hope management plays their cards right. Debt free for the first time in its history, strong cash flow, and a plethora of tailwind to propel this company to unprecedented performance. Would love to see the company capitalize and position itself to blow past ATH of $29 over the next 9 months. GLTA"

Bullish,"@Elstock72 I think $VSTO provides a possible entry here for a swing or long play looking at the annual and history. There are pros and cons to this entry point. It looks a little toppy, putting in a double top after already running over 3 fold to its high point since January, keeping a lot of those gains. BUT, it is also sitting on a handle after forming a C&amp;H off the double top. 

So here is what I think COULD happen: 
 
It could continue higher OR test $24 3-4x and put in a chart very similar to NFLX (which looks ready to level up). I think it has potential to do the former pending on their EPS/REV come through large and in charge. Based off the history, VSTO could go higher if they provide a beat as well as another good catalyst; guidance/div. If it does the latter, you&#39;ll see a better entry.

I think all gun and ammo stocks have potential to reach all time highs if they haven&#39;t already yet so long as they continue to show increased sales and profitability w/ strong guidance. $BGFV!"

Bullish,$LYFT see you tomorrow at $28
Bullish,"$LYFT Deeply undervalued at these levels. Great area to start $ cost averaging in. Prop 22 should pass. If it doesn&#39;t, most drivers will be without a side hustle as Lyft and Uber can only hire a certain # of workers on a full-time basis. As many as 75-80% of drivers could lose their jobs/supplemental income. Plus, salaried workers&#39; # of hours would be limited (healthcare + OT implications), so drivers have to weigh the benefit of potentially earning a bit more with the risk of losing their side hustle (as well as the flexibility &amp; independence that come with it). Outside of Prop 22, Lyft&#39;s recent team-up with Grubhub should provide added value to subscription members &amp; help keep bookings for its delivery service on an ‚Üë trajectory. From a TA perspective, Lyft is currently in the bounce zone having done so around these levels both in early May &amp; August. Strong support ahead of the 61.8% fib at +/-$24.75.

Remember unlike a traditional Pharma company that is drug centric( their entire lifeline is based on the approval on one or two drugs), Xeris is platform-centric(their company was formed around a platform that can literally pump out ANY currently unstable drug and turn it into a stable, non aqueous, non refrigeration needed drug). While their platform has NO direct competitor, their by product drugs do(head on with BIG Pharma). Remember that BIG Pharma pockets will slowly realize that their Xeris Tech can be applied to all their drugs, hmmmm BO potential. They also have multiple collabs with big pharma like Regeneron, Asahi, etc. With their recently approved drug(in July with explosive growth) and upcoming catalysts within the year.

The PIPE issue has been widely discussed , and tbh,GRAF provided the most clear disclosure regarding PIPE resale (whether we hate it or not) compared to other SPACs per my reading.

Monday PM:
$LOGI demand higher than ever; work and school from home. I am personally waiting on my headset for another 11 days. Revenue + EPS up YOY for 4 consec. quarters.
$IBM company is built to last. Chart looks to provide an excellent entry if you are a believer. Broke the 20/50/200 DMA in the last 2 weeks. 
Tuesday PM:
$NFLX The double cup and handle on the annual looks ready to take the next leap on an ER beat. It wants $600.
Wednesday AM/PM:
$VZ getting pushed towards the 200 DMA sitting on the bottom range of the annual uptrend. Might look to enter long.
$TSLA who isn&#39;t watching? Probably the MOST anticipated. Chart looks like it want&#39;s to pullback early in the week into ER, which is healthy IMO. Will they beat w/ sales + EPS up YOY?
Thursday AM:
TSCO: love this stock. I thought we would break 160 last ER but have had to be patient. Put in a huge cup and looking ready. High demand, good CEO."

Bullish,"$EMAN üßêü•É

If you‚Äôre looking to swing trade $EMAN, then I would get in at the end of the month. The manufactured election crisis should knock us back down below $1.20, which is the loading zone. 

Right after the election $EMAN will announce the date of Q3 ER, which will push us back up to the $1.40 - $1.50 zone. A week later, ER will come out and we will hit $2.00. That‚Äôs when I would sell for a quick 90% gain. 

If you feel so inclined, keep a portion of your shares and ride through ER, but that shouldn‚Äôt be necessary since one to two weeks post-ER volume will be gone and we will slowly bleed back down to $1.50 again. 

Just my thoughts after trading this stock for the past 6 months. This is a great company with steady DoD contracts and unique proprietary technology. Best of all, $EMAN is designed and made in the U.S. of A!

The perceived micro &quot;bull market&quot; we&#39;ve been in from say 2009-2020 was really just a smaller leg of a much larger, perpetual bull market that we&#39;ve been in since the stock market&#39;s inception.

All that has changed is how gains are booked, but not the amount that have been booked. We&#39;ve switched from a dividend model to a growth model.

Despite the larger good news that stocks only go up, the bad news is the problem of excessive valuations needs correction in the medium term. And no, the brief 2 monthly corona candles followed by an immediate recovery will not be the medicine. It&#39;ll come later, hopefully far enough out to where we all have a profit cushion."
Bullish,$SPX Looking good on Sunday evening futures - this thing was down going into the weekend but because of positive news from Nancy Pelosi re: COVID-19 Stimulus Bill potential by Tuesday it seems we&#39;ve jumped back to $348 Area.

Bullish,Hope everyone has a good week $SPY gapping up after Friday‚Äôs week close...a move over 3500 on the $Spx will be bullish in my opinion

Bullish,"$CREE Jim Farley starts today as CEO of Ford.  He will be going full blast with electric vehicles. They will need a lot of silicon carbide from the number one source in the world, Cree!"
Bullish,$CREE  building up steam.... probably following market for now.... factory progress is looking good..... 2021 will be the year it&#39;s discovered that CREE has SiC monopoly  .... CREE bet it all that EVs were coming...and they are coming sooner then everyone thought. $TSLA
Bullish,"$CREE All the EV automakers are looking to Cree to produce silicon carbide for their cars and trucks. They also use silicon  carbide for their charging stations. 
 
Silicon carbide as opposed to silicon allows production of 15 to 20% more efficient batteries and charging stations. 
 
 At Cree&#39;s New New York plant  they will hugely increase production. 
 
 Cree is the number one silicon carbide company. To make silicon carbide it is necessary to have a perfect wafer to start out with. With increased technology and tremendous money years of growing there they go to company for this new EV technology. 
 
 I personally bought a huge amount of shares in the last couple of days with that nice drop. Counting on some good gains"

Bullish,"$BOXL My last post on BOXL didn&#39;t make it through the gate with links, however extremely undervalued in relation to its competitors

 ‚ÄúI am thrilled to combine the resources of Boxlight and Sahara, two of the most recognized companies in education technology. The Sahara acquisition expands our geographic reach - particularly in the EMEA region, provides significant revenue growth, results in immediate consolidated profitability, and adds tremendous global management talent. We are committed to achieving dramatic growth, both organically and through acquisitions, and we are delivering on that promise. The combined companies are generating greater than USD 100 million in sales and are highly profitable. I look forward to reporting our consolidated financial statements in future quarters.‚Äù

Bullish,"$VXRT I‚Äôm expecting VXRT to bleed a bit, but I‚Äôm not worried. Now is the time to buy.

For any others looking for other plays while we wait for VXRT to sober up and get its shit together, do some DD on VYST which is primed and mid run. It‚Äôs an OTC 7 cent stock that had a 45% run on Friday.

They finally got their production lineup of FDA certified medical grade UV filtration systems in full swing to meet demand for schools and hospitals. This update is pretty huge as the reason it was languishing before was uncertainty over their ability to deliver.

Also a Covid play. I‚Äôm expecting it to run to 10 cents today."

Bullish,$VXRT Vaxy is holding quite well...a little PR and she will be reversing dramtically.
Bullish,"$VXRT It&#39;s always worrying reading articles that are trying to put &#39;negative light&#39; on the company you are invested in. However, the CNN article is poorly written by a person who I quote from her CNN bio; &#39;Shannon Liao is an associate writer at CNN Business covering video games&#39;. So why she is writing a poor piece on VXRT... I don&#39;t understand. What slightly worries me is the CEO and others have or are working at Armistice Capital. The results from their data are all positive. It&#39;s a balance, if not fraud has been committed then shares will recover and excel, if not they will be hurt. I&#39;m holding."
Bullish,"$VXRT I have Distill Web Monitor scanning vaxarts PR section of their website and its going off for the past 20 minutes, someone is working on that part of the website - preparing for a release perhaps? just a heads up."
Bullish,is lurking in the radioactive shadows at $LEU
Bullish,"$leu To put things in perspective about the Centrus opportunity here.  Look at the website directly from the department of energy. They call for a pressing need of Haleu  over the next 10 years.They specifically say 600 metric tons of Haleu will be needed for demand by 2030.Centrus will only be testing with 10 metric tons over the next two years.20 companies owning reactors will be dependent  on the Haleu fuel when its ready.Most notably, there is no Haleu commercially available at this time.It mentions only Centrus as a developer of this fuel.  Wall street is normally way ahead with buying the story and selling the news.  There are two Analyst following with a buy rating as of recent.Lake Street analyst said it best&quot;&quot;Centrus Energy sits at the center of the re-emerging nuclear power industry with an improved margin structure, multi-year visibility on free cash flow, and a leading position to supply HALEU fuel to next-generation reactors&quot; energy.gov/ne/articles/what....

Bullish,$LEU We&#39;re flying!
Bullish,$BGFV $ZVO $LEU $ENLV $SPTN and SNX have me pretty darn green right now!!!
Bullish,$LEU posted about this yesterday. FAST START TODAY!
Bullish,"$LEU Idaho, Illinois &amp; Ontario Canada all announcing proposals for the Trisco fuel modular reactors.  https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/OPG-advances-towards-SMR-deployment.  From a few days ago. Ontario Canada going to utilize modular nuclear reactors.  https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Micro-modular-reactors-proposed-for-Idaho-and-Illi Look at the companies involved.  All are partnered with Centrus to develop the fuel. Moral of the story is Centrus is positioning to be a forefront global supplier of state of the art clean fuel at a time when nuclear is coming back.  Reminds me of Cheniere energy. It sputtered at first and news came in unnoticed but after the mou‚Äôs started coming in the stock rose 7000% in about 1 year."
Bullish,$LEU the bull pattern is confirmed &amp; a BUY signal is issued @ https://bit.ly/1nPbANX. Buy Level: 10.15   Target: 11.27
Bullish,"$LEU again this is great news with Terrestrial power moa.  Although Nuclear power as a whole remains controversial for some, these new advanced reactor designs are moving forward.  Terra Power who has made it public that they will be helping Centrus build out its centrifuges to meet its commercial operation needs is the equivalent of a loan back guarantee that Centrus was seeking as USEC years ago.  Funny that the stock hasn‚Äôt been moving on this news but the sector is still out of favor.  Despite this, Centrus is not a concept like other hi tech fuel companies such as Lightbridge.  There is already positive cash flow and facilities and assets.  I do believe it‚Äôs only a matter of the me before new institutions if not hedge funds start picking up the stock.  100m market cap is laughable."

Also, no chemical needs to be injected into the sample.  Sample doesn&#39;t have to be frozen and can and should remain at whatever temperature it might happen to be.

At the lab, the whole RNA extraction step that is another entire processing run for other labs will not be done.

Easy, fast.  Lab run time less than 3 hours.

Fluidigm: Trump Administration provides saliva test at surge testing site in Waco, TX  (6.75)
&quot;Starting today, communities that are part of the federal surge testing effort for COVID-19, supported by the Trump Administration, have a new option: a test that uses samples of saliva collected by spitting into a sterile container. Made by Fluidigm Corporation and supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the easy-to-use saliva test detects SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on a molecular level using a microfluidics platform. The accuracy of the test is comparable to other molecular-level tests of nasal swab samples, according to a clinical study conducted by the manufacturer. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has traditionally provided nasal swab tests from other manufacturers to surge testing sites, which remain a choice for community officials.&quot;"

ZM will not tank to $75. ZM can tank to $200-300 only if they lower their guidance. But I cannot see that coming, when businesses‚Äô norm now is to shift 40% to work from home. We have home schooling, churches meetings, college video conferencing, etc."

Bullish,"$ACI I will be here long term, but I do feel that until the sponsors are liquid on this they will continue to add pressure to ACI PPS. I really believe that the 12-month price targets are more in line with a true 12 months on this one as Analysts have anticipated this as well. I would like to see earnings bring $16 at least. Ya know, one would like to think that the sponsors were strategic and opted to let PPS continue to rise and exit in small increments within the climb. Allowing it to continue a positive gains trend. However, they may actually have a target price and algo to sell on triggers and not care. The IPO price would make sense as a trigger but I am not sure how much lower they were in at...So anyone else knows? Break-even PPS amount for the Sponsors? Either way, the sooner they are liquid the sooner ACI gets more inline with KR in fair value on the market. My opinion of course."
Bullish,$ACI we all know how this gap up pm stuff works. Expect a pull down and large buy orders. Gap ups seldom stick.
Bullish,$ACI it‚Äôs time to grow up Mr ACI. Show us what you got
Bullish,$ACI Big volume pre earnings and a great earnings of which I have no doubt gives sponsors the opportunity to dump more into eager hands. Not expecting anything big but over $16 and I&#39;d be happy.

Bullish,"$VXRT Some here question the strength of VXRT&#39;s p1 being an open label trial (vs. randomized, double blind, controlled trial)

My response:
True, open label trial normally is not considered the gold standard of clinical trials [randomized, double blind, controlled].  However, for some indications (e.g. rare cancers, rare diseases, gene therapies), FDA routinely allow companies to conduct open label trials of all phases for approval purpose.

More importantly, for COVID-19 vaccines, MRNA, PFE/BNTX, INO&#39;s phase 1 are all open-label trials.  There may be more, but I think three examples should be sufficient to make the point=VXRT&#39;s open-label p1 is on par with others.

-GE will be around 18.75 by xmass 2022.
-GE will be around $22 by summer 2023.

These are based on projections made by looking at GE chart for the last 30 years and seeing the pattern, along with other reasons debt as debt reduction and improved balance sheet.

Bullish,"$FLDM If you click on &quot;Analysis&quot; on Yahoo! Finance, you&#39;ll see that Fluidigm is covered by 3 analysts (which I believe are BTIG, UBS, and Piper Jaffray).  They give the high, low, and the average, so I had to algebraically determine the mid, but here they are:

Q3:

Low 26.9
Mid 33.47
High 37.01

Avg 32.46

Q4:

Low 33.4
Mid 40.89
High 63.08

Q2 was 26.1 and was a very bad quarter since the company sells cutting edge scientific lab technology and labs were closed worldwide.  Europe was locked down and was down 40%!!!  It was also before their EUA was approved on Aug 25.  Also before they got their Q3 first installment of $12 million (of a total $34 million) from the NIH.

Just Q2&#39;s 26.1 plus 12 = 38.1 without considering labs reopening, multiple Covid test clients during Q3 (both for their own test and their equipment processing others&#39; tests).  So expect a HUGE &quot;beat&quot;."

It‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs birthday tomorrow. Last week I asked her what she wanted as a gift. She said give me something with diamonds. So I decided to give her a pack of playing cards

Because it was my brothers birthday our mom decided to do something special. She called his fraternity house and said she wanted to bring a cake. The kid who took the call was very excited. He said wow that would be great. The next day she drove to the fraternity and rang the doorbell. The same kid answered the door and when he saw the cake his face was sad. He said I am very disappointed I thought you said KEG

Bullish,"$NK Yo short buddies try not to confuse $NK with vxrt today. I know you think $5 is a target for NK but guess what $Vxrt is there already. Maybe you should cover unless there is some substantial negative issue. 
Can&#39;t speak about Vxrt vaccine but both have capsules and are Had5 vector construct(IB/NK has e1,e2b,e3 deletions)  and both are in OWS primate challenge study and both have phase 1 IND approval. But only one has a billionaire CEO like Patrick Soon-Shiong and in&#39;t being investigated by SEC  
How can you go wrong investing with a billionaire ceo? 
 
Here&#39;s an independent study with had5 deletion construct and the basis of a good deal of the work done by NK/IB in many cancer, viral and gene therapy trials .

Same positive results from the OWS funded NHP study, same FDA approval for first human dosing, great preliminary results from the hamster study. The Vaast platform is still a revolutionary positive. The NYT article is months old and all you have to do is read the PR from June to see the first sentence clearly states that the company had been chosen to participate in the OWS FUNDED NON-PRIMATE STUDY and thankfully it looks like they received very positive results from it.  I still think in the long run the press attention will bring new investors who take time to check out the ticker. Good luck trading all and hopefully when the PR about the full NHP data is released, all eyes will be on $VXRT.   Staying calm and I might actually go fishing üé£ today and let the dust settle."

Retail Is already mostly in the red here with no more cash to throw at this. Games will be played. For me, this is a hold until another hot spot is announced or until Nov 6th- If nothing comes from Earnings I am out temporarily. However, remember the tute ownership here. HamburgerHumper would like you to believe that institutional owner ship doesn&#39;t matter- but it absolutely does. They will run CIRCLES around FLDM retail traders all day. 

Not an easy stock to day trade, so don&#39;t suggest it. For me, it&#39;s a simple semi long swing into earnings and that&#39;s all that matters in the near term. 

Lastly, if this closes above 7.20, you should be happy. It&#39;s not about the price over the last 30 days but 3mos-52weeks. 

One location in Waco is great- but we absolutely know there are more and we know there will be more announcements of additional sites.

QCOM ‚Äì alerted at the break of 121 as it gapped nicely to 130$. Could see a pull back and it is quite risky to play earnings on this. If this shoes a bad er or sentiment  becomes bearish this can test $120 after the er report. However, if earnings is perceived bullish this can gap to $140. Risky play off the charts honestly. Best to buy afterwards. 

SNAP- earnings is approaching if this stays above $26 it is still a bullish trend. Look for a push to $30+ if earnings are great for snap. Possibly even 32-35 as well. Could consolidate around 27-28 range until the er. So it is best to monitor the risk and go further out. 

TGT- support is coming up strongly around sma support of 160. This can see a possible upward momentum to $170 which is the upper trendline resistance. With a bullish market condition I can see touching 170 this week. If there is a pull back due to the market then watch the critical level at 160.

These are two smaller holdings that Renaissance carries that I suggest to watch. I took a position last week AIH and week before RVP. Obviously there is some risk associated with Chinese holdings (AIH) but worth noting the technical breakout and who is backing them:

Renaissance owns:
$AIH 3.13% of the company. Broke above the 200 SMA this week and the 20 and 50 the week before. Announced share buyback.
$RVP 4.67% of company and their top institutional investor by more than 2 fold. Chart looking primed as it broke above the 50 this month. High short interest should squeeze this up."

Posted 19-Oct-2020 at 09:50 am EST

After the Trump Administration announced on Friday that Fluidigm&#39;s saliva-based test will be used to support federal surge testing for COVID-19 in Texas, Piper Sandler analyst Steven Mah said he believes test volumes &quot;will be nominal at the beginning,&quot; but could become meaningful if a large second wave occurs. However, Mah views this as &quot;another validation of Fluidigm&#39;s technology for high-throughput COVID-19 testing&quot; and would be a buyer of the stock given the recent pullback. Mah has an Overweight rating and $12 price target on Fluidigm shares."

Bullish,$GOCO average price target $20 plus. Company is growing and does most of its business during Medicare enrollment which is now. So people need to calm the fu$@ down. They are building and hiring and will have the infrastructure ready to grow 5x. They couldn‚Äôt even do this before that‚Äôs why they went public for capital infusion and they are doing what they said they will do. The fact that a lot of people have lost money and the stock is cheap is a buying opportunity and a chance to buy more at lower levels. So stop complaining and stfu and start buying so you can be rich in next couple years. Then say thank you and send me 10 percent for pepping u fuc$ers up
Bullish,$GOCO will buy more if it goes down.
Bullish,"$GOCO thoughts...AEP activity is up with many shoppers. People could not move prior to AEP so they are all lining up now to make sure they have the best plan available.  More expansion, competition, and lower rates with the elimination of the HIT tax.  More engagement from carriers with coop and marketing incentives. This might be a Q4 earnings play.  Most commission should be paid out by dec 31st. With some overflow into Jan.  Looking at deep OTM calls say march  17.50 and 20.00."

Bullish,$TACO - Maybe it&#39;s going to wait for Taco Tuesday to pop....lol...
Bullish,$TACO this has to bounce today! Purely on a technical level!
Bullish,"$TACO There are four ways to improve shareholder value, invest the money in new restaurants/raise revenue, share buy backs, reduce debt or dividends. For whatever reason, Del Taco chose to buy back $10&#39;s of millions in stock and reduce debt by $10&#39;s of millions. They also optimized their company owned portfolio and shed unprofitable stores. Meanwhile, between 2016 and now, stock has traded above $14 like five different times.  Company more profitable than ever. Less stock in the float, less debt and its trading near all time lows?  So don&#39;t look at the flat revenue and make a silly conclusion like they didn&#39;t have money to open stores, they make plenty of money.  Buy and hold. Fundamentals will run anyone over trying to stop what&#39;s inevitable."

Bullish,$TACO happy to be back in. Honestly hoping she opens neat up again so I can have one more loading opportunity because she can only be suppressed so long before she grows ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
Bullish,"$TACO There is no money left to be made short.  3.5 million shares gobbled up in the $8&#39;s, that&#39;s the floor. Analysts have it at $12-$13 a share. There is just no justification to suppress this valuation given the business model and how perfectly suited it is for the times. It will go to $10-$12 in the months ahead. Look at the whole history chart...that&#39;s the range and this company has never been better positioned for the world than it is right now."

US Fed Government:  
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that the Fed is open to collaborating with the private sector on a possible digital U.S. dollar, but reiterated that the central bank has not committed to actually launching one.
‚ÄúWe will have lots of conversations with industry and stakeholder engagement, and that‚Äôll help us in our work on digital currencies and cross-border payments,‚Äù Powell said in an International Monetary Fund panel.
Powell said private sector initiatives like Facebook‚Äôs Libra project have accelerated central banks‚Äô interest in setting up their own digital currencies.

But Powell cautioned that the Fed faces ‚Äúdifficult policy and operational questions,‚Äù such as the monetary policy implications of a digital dollar. Powell also listed illicit activity and cyber attacks as risks.

Where     $31.50 today"
Bullish,$MAXR 1 share traded at 32...don&#39;t get too excited yet ü§£ GLTA! Possible big day ahead!
Bullish,"$MAXR the more I think about it, I&#39;m not sure I want this stock to get bought out. We could get instant gains with a buyout. But the potential for this company in the next decade could far surpass the gains of a buyout today. Market cap is only 1.8 billion, IMO that&#39;s peanuts when you have companies like $spce at over 5B"
Bullish,"$MAXR Maxar circa 2017, Digitalglobe acquisition debt is high as Legion build is just beginning. Stock price $60 with a pending $600M cash burn to build Legion over the next few years.

Maxar today, Legion on track to launch in a few months and facilitate growth in a over subscribed earth intelligence unit. Vricon 3D rendering added as a wholely owned Maxar asset. NASA Artemis contract for power and propulsion entering growth phase as Mars aspersions and 5G satellites fuel SSL resurgence. Stock price $30

So if the company was worth $60 in 2017 how is it worth $30 on the eve of a massive growth cycle? As the first Legion satellite comes online this stock could easily enter the 3 digit club and still have a forward PE under 10. Even at $100, $6.1B Marketcap it would be 1/3 the PS of $IRDM even though it has about 10x the technology wuth robotics and vertically integrated manufacturing. What&#39;s harder imaging 25cm at 15x Per day or sending a text message via satellite? Cheap vs peers."
Bullish,$MAXR patients it will eventually break. This is just what maxr does it gets stuck at a level for awhile then moves up. I&#39;ve thought about trying to play the buy sell game but usually end up missing the leg up and regret not holding. This stock is heading back to $80.

Mark Bedwell looking great after over 1 year and half AFTER having recieved nurown. This completely shatters the bear case regarding phase 2, as the multidose can last very long for the right biomarker (based on public nurown recipients it looks like 15% minimum to a potential over 30% of ALS patients!)

Bullish,"$BCLI We expect BCLI are acquiring commercilsation and production pipelines of the highest calibre.

What are Bcli offering ?...what can they offer ?....shares and future sales cut.

To agree such a deal the company would need what ?.... supreme confidence in Nurown and in Bcli. That&#39;s it."
Bullish,"$BCLI Clearly David Setboun has secured Global commercialisation / production deals. A reminder that his 250k shares are tied to securing the deal within 10 days of unblinding. 

A reminder also that Bcli confirmed they intend to be good to go to treat the maximum number of patients from the off. While not specific, this is good news and exudes confidence.

Now add to this BCLi informing that Patients from anywhere on planet earth can come to the US for treatment. 450,000 pALS.

Analysts will best value the company once we know how much Nurown will cost. I assume around 200k based in Chaims previous comments and Radicava apparently costing around 148k pa. 

Being a global deal, I forsee a seriously big named partner or two. What that does to the SP is sure to create volatility with many selling after read-out but that also being the signal for Tutes to build.

Then !...so many other indications lined up that the value of the company will be staggering."
Bullish,"$BCLI Good morning all, especially to new investors. The longs try and keep this board informative and factual. Many will help with pointers on DD. I&#39;ll provide some here.

Be advised that with data read-out probably less than 40 days away, you will see negative comments from bears and Chaim haters, but they cannot point to even 1 fact connected to the trial which suggests failure is possible.
Do not have stop losses on, bears can see this."

I feel the date was pushed back for a couple of reasons: 1)Wkhs had to get access to more capital, that happened this week. 2) I feel that the merger between. Workhorse and Lordstown/GM is the last thing that has to happen before the contract can be awarded.  That can happen as soon as Oct 22.  3) After Oct 22, say Oct 25/26 a subsequent merger between wkhs/LT/GM can be announced.  This gives usps what it wants and give Trump a chance to stand in Lordstown and take credit for it.  He did tell the layed off GM employees &quot;dont sell your house&quot;.  He can claim a promise kept in a crucial state when he award 70% of contract (for cities n suburbs in warm climates to wkhs).  He then announces 30% to Ford (for rural routes and colder climates) to Ford/Oshkosh to gain votes in Michigan ($F ) and Wisconsin ($OSK ).  Minda and Votes in 3 key states changed."

Once enough supply is available globally, it will be granted formal approval by the FDA and EMA for routine use in asymptomatic and mildly ill patients - much like Tamiflu is used.

&quot;Weyland acquired Push to support the launch of its CreateApp mCommerce and mobile fintech solutions in North America, as well as additional eCommerce products and services globally. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in the first full calendar quarter as part of Weyland.&quot;

&quot;Weyland reported last fall trailing 12-month recurring revenues of more than $32 million, with Push recently reporting that it has sustained a significant return to growth in the second half of 2019, ending the year at a nearly $12 million annual run-rate, up more than 300% since mid-year.&quot;&quot;

&quot;CreateApp requires literally no technical understanding or skills in app design for anyone to build a full-featured custom app in less than two hours. CreateApp is a Shopify-like solution for mobile that enables businesses and brands to establish a mCommerce presence in an intuitive, do-it-yourself fashion.&quot;

Made by Fluidigm Corporation and supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the easy-to-use saliva test detects SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on a molecular level using a microfluidics platform.

HHS has traditionally provided nasal swab testing to surge testing sites (which still remain a choice for community officials), we consider this an encouraging in-road into wider adoption of Fluidigm&#39;s saliva-based test, which provides an easier sampling alternative, as it is less invasive and does not require swabs or special collection devices.

CSX- Still in a bullish trend if it trades above $80. This could see 82-83 near term and could be a sleeper play that you can monitor. Doesn‚Äôt have much volume in options but you can snag one or two for a good gain if it does breakout. Earnings this week. 

FCX- trading within the wedge still and earnings will either take it pass the top trend resistance at 18$ or more or break down the wedge which can potentially hit  mid low 16s.  This could be a strong watch for all precious metal plays. Maybe a potential record earnings beat can push this to the $20 target I set from two months ago.

Bullish,"$ZM Couple a weeks ago at $500 bears were saying the same thing -- pig, overvalued, gonna drop like a rock. Somebody mocked me for buying $500 Nov. calls. They doubled,  and today I rolled them to $600 Dec. calls, cashing out $30,000.  It could pull back for sure, which is why I took some profits, but earnings are going to be amazing so you want to be in for that. By the way, everybody saying there is too much competition has not used these products. There are clear advantages Zoom has over everything else I&#39;ve tried, with more on the way.  I defied my IT department who wanted me to use something else, and so many other faculty at my university did the same that they gave in and said they would support Zoom. It&#39;s just better."
