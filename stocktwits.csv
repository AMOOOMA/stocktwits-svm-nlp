NO_LABEL,"$CNK i was upside down on this but ended up buying 6 x‚Äôs my position yesterday at its low and actually made a little $. Unfortunately, i agree with the rest on streaming is where its at and if these movie companies are making deals with streaming platforms then its all over for theaters. I would then think $IMAX could grow seeing it is a whole different experience. Thoughts?"
NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:

#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued

#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal

#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)

#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month)

AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"
NO_LABEL,"$CNK - missed that sub $7 for $MCS today, but I did nab some $NCMI at $2.07

NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"

#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued

#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month)

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

NO_LABEL,"$CNK i was upside down on this but ended up buying 6 x‚Äôs my position yesterday at its low and actually made a little $. Unfortunately, i agree with the rest on streaming is where its at and if these movie companies are making deals with streaming platforms then its all over for theaters. I would then think $IMAX could grow seeing it is a whole different experience. Thoughts?"
NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"
NO_LABEL,"$CNK - missed that sub $7 for $MCS today, but I did nab some $NCMI at $2.07 
 
Anyone else watching the best in breed theater stocks this week? I am ready for $IMAX if it ever touches below 10$

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

He concluded by saying that debt is 1.8x EBITDA, down from 4.7x just 2.5 years ago, so it&#39;s no longer an issue, and their FCF allows them to continue paying it down and also pay a dividend, which they subsequently announced a few days ago.

Bullish,"$HBAN here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll see over and over, and why HBAN will crack $12 next week...

The key question for the quarter: Whether American banks would show that they‚Äôre largely done setting aside money for loan defaults tied to the pandemic. That appears to be the case at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, which had a $611 million provision in credit costs in the period, compared with $10.5 billion in the previous quarter.

Rather than building loan-loss reserves, as it had done aggressively in the first half of the year, JPMorgan actually reduced them by $569 million in the quarter, citing a runoff in its mortgage portfolio. The bank had added more than $15 billion to loan loss reserves in the first two quarters of 2020."

Definitely also looking for LVS earnings on Wednesday (10/21) ... hearing that Las Vegas is doing really bad with many restaurants and stores closed along the Strip and preparing to file for BK in the coming weeks ... and btw we live here. The type of visitors to Las Vegas has fallen off a cliff with street fights and shootings along the Strip ... hotel rooms at only a few bucks (like Flamingo at $23/night on the weekend plus resort fee).
And then the airline earnings of AAL and LUV will be interesting to see their continuous cash burn rate and how business is just not coming back."

I wonder what&#39;s going to happen after 3rd raise of $250M .... hmmm ü§î
