NO_LABEL,"$CNK i was upside down on this but ended up buying 6 x‚Äôs my position yesterday at its low and actually made a little $. Unfortunately, i agree with the rest on streaming is where its at and if these movie companies are making deals with streaming platforms then its all over for theaters. I would then think $IMAX could grow seeing it is a whole different experience. Thoughts?"
NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:

#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued

#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal

#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)

#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month)

AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"
NO_LABEL,"$CNK - missed that sub $7 for $MCS today, but I did nab some $NCMI at $2.07

NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"

#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued

#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month)

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

NO_LABEL,"$CNK i was upside down on this but ended up buying 6 x‚Äôs my position yesterday at its low and actually made a little $. Unfortunately, i agree with the rest on streaming is where its at and if these movie companies are making deals with streaming platforms then its all over for theaters. I would then think $IMAX could grow seeing it is a whole different experience. Thoughts?"
NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"
NO_LABEL,"$CNK - missed that sub $7 for $MCS today, but I did nab some $NCMI at $2.07 
 
Anyone else watching the best in breed theater stocks this week? I am ready for $IMAX if it ever touches below 10$

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

Bought the pepp pizza cause it‚Äôs limited time and the zucchini spirals.. the a√ßa√≠ bowls and corn were available at Costco though , had a chance to peep  inside when riding through. So it seems they are trading traditional space for items like a√ßa√≠ bowls   and corn for these new limited time only meals..so what I gathered is we got granted new space for the newer micro meals at Walmart and swapped space at sams club to try out new products.

Now that doesn&#39;t mean I am holding that whole position that long. If it does something ridiculous and jumps more than is justified I will reduce to core holdings which would be 100 shares per account.

I know many are worried about a mortgage default crisis coming in the next year since unemployment remains high and many homeowners are in forbearance plans. Last week, we saw a material decline in the forbearance rate. Obviously, the forbearance rate would decrease as the plans expire. 

So the question becomes what percentage of those that exited forbearance will be likely to pay the bill? MBA tells us that, &quot;nearly two-thirds of borrowers who exited forbearance remained current on their payments, repaid their forborne payments, or moved into a payment deferral plan. All of these borrowers have been able to resume - or continue - their pre-pandemic monthly payments.&quot;

That is great news. The majority of people who are exiting forbearance have the ability to make payments. We can expect the majority of the other one-third to extend their forbearance plan.

Let&#39;s find one that has fraudulent accounting, is technically overbought, and is about to pull back due to the momentum trade now failing. Ignore the rising competition from dozens of other EV and hydrogen companies. Forget about XPEV owning the low-end of the market in China and growing into NIO&#39;s space. And pretend that the average Chinese worker makes more than just $3,500 in an entire year! Let&#39;s buy NIO at the top of its trading range when the stock just became way overbought... that sounds smart. When the communists are killing Indian soldiers on the border, flexing on their other neighbors like 1930&#39;s Germany, and now threatening the USA... what will happen to NIO stock.

He concluded by saying that debt is 1.8x EBITDA, down from 4.7x just 2.5 years ago, so it&#39;s no longer an issue, and their FCF allows them to continue paying it down and also pay a dividend, which they subsequently announced a few days ago.

It seems like a bad idea to get too close to a massive tornado in real life. Fortunately, we can live vicariously through ‚ÄúTwister.‚Äù Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt lead an impressive cast of storm chasers, including a flying cow that has become pretty iconic in and of itself. Chase the storm with DirecTV or on Fubo.

Bullish,"$HBAN here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll see over and over, and why HBAN will crack $12 next week...

The key question for the quarter: Whether American banks would show that they‚Äôre largely done setting aside money for loan defaults tied to the pandemic. That appears to be the case at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, which had a $611 million provision in credit costs in the period, compared with $10.5 billion in the previous quarter.

Rather than building loan-loss reserves, as it had done aggressively in the first half of the year, JPMorgan actually reduced them by $569 million in the quarter, citing a runoff in its mortgage portfolio. The bank had added more than $15 billion to loan loss reserves in the first two quarters of 2020."

The type of visitors to Las Vegas has fallen off a cliff with street fights and shootings along the Strip ... hotel rooms at only a few bucks (like Flamingo at $23/night on the weekend plus resort fee).

Bullish,"$UVV Cheap high yielding dividend champion trading at 80% of shareholder&#39;s equity, below fair value RSI, 14PE, bottom of strong upward channel. Aggressive dividend growth recently from a company that&#39;s older than the dirt its product is grown on. Company hasn&#39;t seen much growth recently so I sort of see it like a $T that&#39;ll spit off a stable, modestly-growing dividend which I can put in other things. Reason it&#39;s better than $T though is there&#39;s still a lot more room for capital appreciation given the value it&#39;s currently trading at. 

Also just a random thought but it would be really interesting to me if these guys could pivot with the land/machinery/building assets they&#39;ve got to move into mj. This seems to be the way that big tobacco is moving into the future in order to combat the shrinkage of the industry, along with vaping (see $MO). These guys have the farming background/experience. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there&#39;s internal talks of such things."

Bullish,"@Elstock72 I think $VSTO provides a possible entry here for a swing or long play looking at the annual and history. There are pros and cons to this entry point. It looks a little toppy, putting in a double top after already running over 3 fold to its high point since January, keeping a lot of those gains. BUT, it is also sitting on a handle after forming a C&amp;H off the double top. 

So here is what I think COULD happen: 
 
It could continue higher OR test $24 3-4x and put in a chart very similar to NFLX (which looks ready to level up). I think it has potential to do the former pending on their EPS/REV come through large and in charge. Based off the history, VSTO could go higher if they provide a beat as well as another good catalyst; guidance/div. If it does the latter, you&#39;ll see a better entry.

I think all gun and ammo stocks have potential to reach all time highs if they haven&#39;t already yet so long as they continue to show increased sales and profitability w/ strong guidance. $BGFV!"

Bullish,$LYFT see you tomorrow at $28
Bullish,"$LYFT Deeply undervalued at these levels. Great area to start $ cost averaging in. Prop 22 should pass. If it doesn&#39;t, most drivers will be without a side hustle as Lyft and Uber can only hire a certain # of workers on a full-time basis. As many as 75-80% of drivers could lose their jobs/supplemental income. Plus, salaried workers&#39; # of hours would be limited (healthcare + OT implications), so drivers have to weigh the benefit of potentially earning a bit more with the risk of losing their side hustle (as well as the flexibility &amp; independence that come with it). Outside of Prop 22, Lyft&#39;s recent team-up with Grubhub should provide added value to subscription members &amp; help keep bookings for its delivery service on an ‚Üë trajectory. From a TA perspective, Lyft is currently in the bounce zone having done so around these levels both in early May &amp; August. Strong support ahead of the 61.8% fib at +/-$24.75.

Next week is a big and important week for SPAC mergers and would bring more clarity on a few SPACs regarding their merger vote dates: LCA, SAMA, HCCO, HCCH and CFFA.

(OPES‚Äôs merger deadline is 11/15, so assuming it could complete the SEC review by the end of this month to schedule a merger vote on 11/13)

Please note that all estimated dates are subjected to change.
We will update the calendar once pertinent info become available.

~The SPACs strike back~

So far, this October has been proven &quot;exciting&quot; with all the up/down and market uncertainty. A busy week ahead with 4 merger votes and culminate with highly anticipated FMCI/TTCF. Then DPHC and SPAQ, two high profile mergers will also be completed soon.

The PIPE issue has been widely discussed , and tbh,GRAF provided the most clear disclosure regarding PIPE resale (whether we hate it or not) compared to other SPACs per my reading. This indeed echoes the SEC Chief&#39;s comment about more transparency for public shareholders. I think in the long run, it would be good for us retails. 
(Plus, PIPE is not all bad, plz see posrs by @kaasi)
