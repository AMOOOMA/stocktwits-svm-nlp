NO_LABEL,"$CNK i was upside down on this but ended up buying 6 x‚Äôs my position yesterday at its low and actually made a little $. Unfortunately, i agree with the rest on streaming is where its at and if these movie companies are making deals with streaming platforms then its all over for theaters. I would then think $IMAX could grow seeing it is a whole different experience. Thoughts?"
NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:

#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued

#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal

#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)

#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month)

AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"
NO_LABEL,"$CNK - missed that sub $7 for $MCS today, but I did nab some $NCMI at $2.07

NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"

#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued

#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month)

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

NO_LABEL,"$CNK i was upside down on this but ended up buying 6 x‚Äôs my position yesterday at its low and actually made a little $. Unfortunately, i agree with the rest on streaming is where its at and if these movie companies are making deals with streaming platforms then its all over for theaters. I would then think $IMAX could grow seeing it is a whole different experience. Thoughts?"
NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"
NO_LABEL,"$CNK - missed that sub $7 for $MCS today, but I did nab some $NCMI at $2.07 
 
Anyone else watching the best in breed theater stocks this week? I am ready for $IMAX if it ever touches below 10$

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:  
  
#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued  
  
#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal  
  
#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)  
  
#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month) 
 
AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"

TLDR: Plenty of buying opportunities ahead 
 
Technicals 
 
This week we were presented with our first buying opportunity post September when hopefully everyone loaded up.  As you can see we‚Äôve hit our first retracement levels off of our prior highs.  On the daily chart currently the price action is sitting on the 50 SMA which is BUY opportunity.  We ended the week with a candlestick that shows a tall wick to the upside which is typically bearish in nature, as well as it being towards the top of an uptrend so we can expect a reversal going into next week with buying opportunities present. 
 
Fundamentals 
 
According to their last quarterly earnings we see that revenues are in line with growth projections.  Hardware revenues are offset by services.  We see by the last presentation that Apple is stretching their product margins as much as possible with introducing cases, mag safe, Apple One.  Margins continue to be &gt;30% which is amazing at this time."

He concluded by saying that debt is 1.8x EBITDA, down from 4.7x just 2.5 years ago, so it&#39;s no longer an issue, and their FCF allows them to continue paying it down and also pay a dividend, which they subsequently announced a few days ago.

The key question for the quarter: Whether American banks would show that they‚Äôre largely done setting aside money for loan defaults tied to the pandemic. That appears to be the case at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, which had a $611 million provision in credit costs in the period, compared with $10.5 billion in the previous quarter.

Rather than building loan-loss reserves, as it had done aggressively in the first half of the year, JPMorgan actually reduced them by $569 million in the quarter, citing a runoff in its mortgage portfolio. The bank had added more than $15 billion to loan loss reserves in the first two quarters of 2020."

The type of visitors to Las Vegas has fallen off a cliff with street fights and shootings along the Strip ... hotel rooms at only a few bucks (like Flamingo at $23/night on the weekend plus resort fee).

Bullish,$HUYA Very conservative $36 projection for this Chinese company! Very low risk!
Bullish,"$HUYA OK, Doesn&#39;t HUYA shareholders get a $1 dividend on the merger? Or does DOYU shareholders also get it?
If so, doesn&#39;t that have to be factored in? 
Also, think of what will happen if the merger doesn&#39;t go through."
Bullish,$HUYA From twitter!
Bullish,$HUYA Could not wait to get home from work and post here!  $ARKK purchased 451 THOUSAND SHARES  of $DOYU .  That is over a Million shares in 3 trading days!  $DOYU shares after they collect the dividend convert to $HUYA shares!  Cathie is so smart!!!
Bullish,"$HUYA Do people expect nothing but green days for this stock since the merger was announced? You have to have patience people merger will be completed 1H 2021. This is your time to add while we wait. Have a exit if you get scared out, and know discipline on when to take profits. Its only been 4 days since the announcment and I have never seen this much complaining about a company nearly doubling in size. Patience :)"

The next was $90 announced 7/13/2020 and share price jumped from around $8 to $17.49 (actually closer to $19.50 premarket) which again was new 52-week high 

I wonder what&#39;s going to happen after 3rd raise of $250M .... hmmm ü§î

Pros:

üëâ Broad Pipeline
üëâ Interim Data readout for Limb Ischemia this quarter
üëâ ARDS for Covid Sideplay

Cons:
üëâ Poor financials - High Chance of offering soon, perhaps right after next data readout.

Bullish,$T such underrated company. People often think they‚Äôre a telecommunication company but the truth is they‚Äôre more of a conglomerate media company. Soon people will realize it‚Äôs bigger than Netflix and everybody else.
Bullish,"$UVV Cheap high yielding dividend champion trading at 80% of shareholder&#39;s equity, below fair value RSI, 14PE, bottom of strong upward channel. Aggressive dividend growth recently from a company that&#39;s older than the dirt its product is grown on. Company hasn&#39;t seen much growth recently so I sort of see it like a $T that&#39;ll spit off a stable, modestly-growing dividend which I can put in other things. Reason it&#39;s better than $T though is there&#39;s still a lot more room for capital appreciation given the value it&#39;s currently trading at. 

Also just a random thought but it would be really interesting to me if these guys could pivot with the land/machinery/building assets they&#39;ve got to move into mj. This seems to be the way that big tobacco is moving into the future in order to combat the shrinkage of the industry, along with vaping (see $MO). These guys have the farming background/experience. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there&#39;s internal talks of such things."
