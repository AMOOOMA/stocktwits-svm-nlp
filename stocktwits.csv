NO_LABEL,"$CNK i was upside down on this but ended up buying 6 x‚Äôs my position yesterday at its low and actually made a little $. Unfortunately, i agree with the rest on streaming is where its at and if these movie companies are making deals with streaming platforms then its all over for theaters. I would then think $IMAX could grow seeing it is a whole different experience. Thoughts?"
NO_LABEL,"My &quot;theater&quot; personal picks:

#1 $CNK: Strong asset value, proven good money management - and exposure to the fastest growing theater market (Latin America). The best theater chain, strongly undervalued

#2 $MCS: Second best theater chain in financial/asset terms (but tiny compared to CNK), it is balanced out with resorts if theaters have a slow return to normal

#3 $NCMI: Hardly any expenses exposure. When it has no revenue it also has limited expenses. It will be a strong beneficiary of theaters reopening (it is pretty much like the monopoly of &quot;Google ads of the internet&quot; but in the theater industry)

#4 $IMAX: OK books but very strong IP value with their widescreen format Also a win with their exposure in China which has already seen huge return to normal benefits already (theater attendance was up 20% year/year in China this month)

AMC, Cineworld - not a fan - they have more debt than any value, run and hide!"
NO_LABEL,"$CNK - missed that sub $7 for $MCS today, but I did nab some $NCMI at $2.07

He concluded by saying that debt is 1.8x EBITDA, down from 4.7x just 2.5 years ago, so it&#39;s no longer an issue, and their FCF allows them to continue paying it down and also pay a dividend, which they subsequently announced a few days ago.

The key question for the quarter: Whether American banks would show that they‚Äôre largely done setting aside money for loan defaults tied to the pandemic. That appears to be the case at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, which had a $611 million provision in credit costs in the period, compared with $10.5 billion in the previous quarter.

Rather than building loan-loss reserves, as it had done aggressively in the first half of the year, JPMorgan actually reduced them by $569 million in the quarter, citing a runoff in its mortgage portfolio. The bank had added more than $15 billion to loan loss reserves in the first two quarters of 2020."
