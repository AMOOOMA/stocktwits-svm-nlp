You forgot to say that the left is already working to further scare and divide the American ppl by going on national tv and telling the ppl not to trust the CDC and the FDA on the safety of c19 vaccines. You forgot to say the govt has already set plans in motion and recruited CVS and Walgreens as well as military logistics to deliver c19 vaccines to the ppl, and instead, the left has gone on national tv to say just the opposite."

Bearish,"$AMD Reminder: Investing in semi conductors is more than who has the fastest CPUs; business metrics and valuations also must be considered.

&quot;Numerically, it is standing at 86% as of October 16, which means that ~86% of AMD’s market cap is derived from expectations for future growth.&quot;

&quot;To showcase how utterly exaggerated the current sentiment is regarding the company’s future EVA growth potential, we ran an enterprising scenario through our discounted EVA model, assuming an Intel-like 10% EVA Margin coupled with an EVA growth of 15% annually for the next 10 years. The resulting $32 valuation for AMD’s shares is fundamentally disconnected from today&#39;s extravagant price of $83.17, turning AMD into not much more than a reckless bet at today’s levels.&quot;

&quot;Numerically, it is standing at 86% as of October 16, which means that ~86% of AMD’s market cap is derived from expectations for future growth.&quot;

&quot;To showcase how utterly exaggerated the current sentiment is regarding the company’s future EVA growth potential, we ran an enterprising scenario through our discounted EVA model, assuming an Intel-like 10% EVA Margin coupled with an EVA growth of 15% annually for the next 10 years. The resulting $32 valuation for AMD’s shares is fundamentally disconnected from today&#39;s extravagant price of $83.17, turning AMD into not much more than a reckless bet at today’s levels.&quot;

Wilson added that the lack of fiscal stimulus, uncertainty around the election, and a second wave of coronavirus are headwinds to near-term stock gains. 

Investors should reallocate their portfolios with stocks that hinge on the economic reopening, he said.

Bearish,"The S&amp;P 500 will likely see a 10% correction in the near term before the bull market continues, according to Morgan Stanley&#39;s chief investment officer. 
&quot;With so many uncertainties over the next month, we think another 10% correction from Monday&#39;s highs is the most likely outcome in the near term before this bull market can resume,&quot; Mike Wilson wrote in a Monday note.
The benchmark index saw its first 10% correction in the new bull market in September. After breaking 3,500, it quickly retreated 10%, explained Wilson. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 attempted to break through 3,550 again, but failed, a sign that Wilson said demonstrates that the correction that began in September is not over.
Wilson added that the S&amp;P 500&#39;s attempted breakthrough last week &quot;occured on less momentum&quot; than in September, which suggests that there is more downside to come before the bull market can resume.

He concluded by saying that debt is 1.8x EBITDA, down from 4.7x just 2.5 years ago, so it&#39;s no longer an issue, and their FCF allows them to continue paying it down and also pay a dividend, which they subsequently announced a few days ago.

The key question for the quarter: Whether American banks would show that they’re largely done setting aside money for loan defaults tied to the pandemic. That appears to be the case at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, which had a $611 million provision in credit costs in the period, compared with $10.5 billion in the previous quarter.

Rather than building loan-loss reserves, as it had done aggressively in the first half of the year, JPMorgan actually reduced them by $569 million in the quarter, citing a runoff in its mortgage portfolio. The bank had added more than $15 billion to loan loss reserves in the first two quarters of 2020."

The type of visitors to Las Vegas has fallen off a cliff with street fights and shootings along the Strip ... hotel rooms at only a few bucks (like Flamingo at $23/night on the weekend plus resort fee).

The next was $90 announced 7/13/2020 and share price jumped from around $8 to $17.49 (actually closer to $19.50 premarket) which again was new 52-week high 

I wonder what&#39;s going to happen after 3rd raise of $250M .... hmmm 🤔 

I may be wrong but if history serves as indicator, then stands to reason that VXRT shareholders will see a new 52-week high over $17.49

📊TA: Trading close to yearly support @$10.66, next small resistance at Sep 01 high of $11.61

Pros:
👉 Breakthrough 3D Platform Tech for cell therapies
👉 Broad Pipeline
👉 Interim Data readout for Limb Ischemia this quarter
👉 ARDS for Covid Sideplay

Cons:
👉 Poor financials - High Chance of offering soon, perhaps right after next data readout.

Bullish,"$UVV Cheap high yielding dividend champion trading at 80% of shareholder&#39;s equity, below fair value RSI, 14PE, bottom of strong upward channel. Aggressive dividend growth recently from a company that&#39;s older than the dirt its product is grown on. Company hasn&#39;t seen much growth recently so I sort of see it like a $T that&#39;ll spit off a stable, modestly-growing dividend which I can put in other things. Reason it&#39;s better than $T though is there&#39;s still a lot more room for capital appreciation given the value it&#39;s currently trading at. 

Also just a random thought but it would be really interesting to me if these guys could pivot with the land/machinery/building assets they&#39;ve got to move into mj. This seems to be the way that big tobacco is moving into the future in order to combat the shrinkage of the industry, along with vaping (see $MO). These guys have the farming background/experience. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there&#39;s internal talks of such things."

Bullish,"@Elstock72 I think $VSTO provides a possible entry here for a swing or long play looking at the annual and history. There are pros and cons to this entry point. It looks a little toppy, putting in a double top after already running over 3 fold to its high point since January, keeping a lot of those gains. BUT, it is also sitting on a handle after forming a C&amp;H off the double top. 

So here is what I think COULD happen: 
 
It could continue higher OR test $24 3-4x and put in a chart very similar to NFLX (which looks ready to level up). I think it has potential to do the former pending on their EPS/REV come through large and in charge. Based off the history, VSTO could go higher if they provide a beat as well as another good catalyst; guidance/div. If it does the latter, you&#39;ll see a better entry.

I think all gun and ammo stocks have potential to reach all time highs if they haven&#39;t already yet so long as they continue to show increased sales and profitability w/ strong guidance. $BGFV!"

Bullish,$LYFT see you tomorrow at $28
Bullish,"$LYFT Deeply undervalued at these levels. Great area to start $ cost averaging in. Prop 22 should pass. If it doesn&#39;t, most drivers will be without a side hustle as Lyft and Uber can only hire a certain # of workers on a full-time basis. As many as 75-80% of drivers could lose their jobs/supplemental income. Plus, salaried workers&#39; # of hours would be limited (healthcare + OT implications), so drivers have to weigh the benefit of potentially earning a bit more with the risk of losing their side hustle (as well as the flexibility &amp; independence that come with it). Outside of Prop 22, Lyft&#39;s recent team-up with Grubhub should provide added value to subscription members &amp; help keep bookings for its delivery service on an ↑ trajectory. From a TA perspective, Lyft is currently in the bounce zone having done so around these levels both in early May &amp; August. Strong support ahead of the 61.8% fib at +/-$24.75. Long from $25.25 on Friday. Will look to add on a dip towards $20 (if that happens)"

Remember unlike a traditional Pharma company that is drug centric( their entire lifeline is based on the approval on one or two drugs), Xeris is platform-centric(their company was formed around a platform that can literally pump out ANY currently unstable drug and turn it into a stable, non aqueous, non refrigeration needed drug). While their platform has NO direct competitor, their by product drugs do(head on with BIG Pharma).

They also have multiple collabs with big pharma like Regeneron, Asahi, etc. With their recently approved drug(in July with explosive growth) and upcoming catalysts within the year.

(OPES’s merger deadline is 11/15, so assuming it could complete the SEC review by the end of this month to schedule a merger vote on 11/13)

So far, this October has been proven &quot;exciting&quot; with all the up/down and market uncertainty. A busy week ahead with 4 merger votes and culminate with highly anticipated FMCI/TTCF. Then DPHC and SPAQ, two high profile mergers will also be completed soon.

The PIPE issue has been widely discussed , and tbh,GRAF provided the most clear disclosure regarding PIPE resale (whether we hate it or not) compared to other SPACs per my reading. This indeed echoes the SEC Chief&#39;s comment about more transparency for public shareholders. I think in the long run, it would be good for us retails. 
(Plus, PIPE is not all bad, plz see posrs by @kaasi)

Not quite aware of details yet, nor is she, but they&#39;ve been issued by the NIH and will arrive within the next week or so. Apparently a Biomark was purchased as well. So I&#39;d imagine much more tests will be performed than 15k

Will keep the boards updated!"
Bullish,"$FLDM never underestimate the power of the United States Government. Small caps are often measured on growth &amp; potential. 

Fluidigm has a large network of Biomarks in place throughout the United States in College Labs. they have 22 Million of manufacturing money going towards more. 

The labs and connections are piling up and the Federal government could add Fluidigm to more surge sites or provide bulk ordering and just instantly cripple shorts. 

Estimates
-Vero 3,000 daily
-Immunogenics 3,000 daily
-Missouri  will grow to 20,000 daily
-Greece 5,000 daily
- Spain 
-Mirxes &gt;&gt;who knows 500k kits weekly to 20 countries how much is Fluidigm of that )

Bullish,"EW&#39;s most anticipated list for next week. Some names I will be watching closely. 👀

Monday PM:
$LOGI demand higher than ever; work and school from home. I am personally waiting on my headset for another 11 days. Revenue + EPS up YOY for 4 consec. quarters.
$IBM company is built to last. Chart looks to provide an excellent entry if you are a believer. Broke the 20/50/200 DMA in the last 2 weeks. 
Tuesday PM:
$NFLX The double cup and handle on the annual looks ready to take the next leap on an ER beat. It wants $600.
Wednesday AM/PM:
$VZ getting pushed towards the 200 DMA sitting on the bottom range of the annual uptrend. Might look to enter long.
$TSLA who isn&#39;t watching? Probably the MOST anticipated. Chart looks like it want&#39;s to pullback early in the week into ER, which is healthy IMO. Will they beat w/ sales + EPS up YOY?
Thursday AM:
TSCO: love this stock. I thought we would break 160 last ER but have had to be patient. Put in a huge cup and looking ready. High demand, good CEO."

Bullish,"$LMT Buy the October dips 

@Iwillplay"
Bullish,$LMT Earnings Tues. before the bell
Bullish,"$EMAN 🧐🥃

If you’re looking to swing trade $EMAN, then I would get in at the end of the month. The manufactured election crisis should knock us back down below $1.20, which is the loading zone. 

Right after the election $EMAN will announce the date of Q3 ER, which will push us back up to the $1.40 - $1.50 zone. A week later, ER will come out and we will hit $2.00. That’s when I would sell for a quick 90% gain. 

If you feel so inclined, keep a portion of your shares and ride through ER, but that shouldn’t be necessary since one to two weeks post-ER volume will be gone and we will slowly bleed back down to $1.50 again. 

Just my thoughts after trading this stock for the past 6 months. This is a great company with steady DoD contracts and unique proprietary technology. Best of all, $EMAN is designed and made in the U.S. of A!

I came across the following chart, which essentially proves that throughout the entirety of its existence....there has been no change. The perceived micro &quot;bull market&quot; we&#39;ve been in from say 2009-2020 was really just a smaller leg of a much larger, perpetual bull market that we&#39;ve been in since the stock market&#39;s inception.

All that has changed is how gains are booked, but not the amount that have been booked. We&#39;ve switched from a dividend model to a growth model.

Despite the larger good news that stocks only go up, the bad news is the problem of excessive valuations needs correction in the medium term. And no, the brief 2 monthly corona candles followed by an immediate recovery will not be the medicine. It&#39;ll come later, hopefully far enough out to where we all have a profit cushion."

All are partnered with Centrus to develop the fuel. Moral of the story is Centrus is positioning to be a forefront global supplier of state of the art clean fuel at a time when nuclear is coming back.  Reminds me of Cheniere energy. It sputtered at first and news came in unnoticed but after the mou’s started coming in the stock rose 7000% in about 1 year."

Terra Power who has made it public that they will be helping Centrus build out its centrifuges to meet its commercial operation needs is the equivalent of a loan back guarantee that Centrus was seeking as USEC years ago.  Funny that the stock hasn’t been moving on this news but the sector is still out of favor.  Despite this, Centrus is not a concept like other hi tech fuel companies such as Lightbridge.  There is already positive cash flow and facilities and assets.  I do believe it’s only a matter of the me before new institutions if not hedge funds start picking up the stock.  100m market cap is laughable."

Also, no chemical needs to be injected into the sample.  Sample doesn&#39;t have to be frozen and can and should remain at whatever temperature it might happen to be.

At the lab, the whole RNA extraction step that is another entire processing run for other labs will not be done.

Easy, fast.  Lab run time less than 3 hours.

Fluidigm: Trump Administration provides saliva test at surge testing site in Waco, TX  (6.75)
&quot;Starting today, communities that are part of the federal surge testing effort for COVID-19, supported by the Trump Administration, have a new option: a test that uses samples of saliva collected by spitting into a sterile container. Made by Fluidigm Corporation and supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the easy-to-use saliva test detects SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on a molecular level using a microfluidics platform. The accuracy of the test is comparable to other molecular-level tests of nasal swab samples, according to a clinical study conducted by the manufacturer. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has traditionally provided nasal swab tests from other manufacturers to surge testing sites, which remain a choice for community officials.&quot;"

Ya know, one would like to think that the sponsors were strategic and opted to let PPS continue to rise and exit in small increments within the climb. Allowing it to continue a positive gains trend. However, they may actually have a target price and algo to sell on triggers and not care. The IPO price would make sense as a trigger but I am not sure how much lower they were in at...So anyone else knows? Break-even PPS amount for the Sponsors?

My response:
True, open label trial normally is not considered the gold standard of clinical trials [randomized, double blind, controlled].  However, for some indications (e.g. rare cancers, rare diseases, gene therapies), FDA routinely allow companies to conduct open label trials of all phases for approval purpose.

More importantly, for COVID-19 vaccines, MRNA, PFE/BNTX, INO&#39;s phase 1 are all open-label trials.  There may be more, but I think three examples should be sufficient to make the point=VXRT&#39;s open-label p1 is on par with others.

Q3:

Low 26.9
Mid 33.47
High 37.01

Avg 32.46

Q4:

Low 33.4
Mid 40.89
High 63.08

Q2 was 26.1 and was a very bad quarter since the company sells cutting edge scientific lab technology and labs were closed worldwide.  Europe was locked down and was down 40%!!!  It was also before their EUA was approved on Aug 25.  Also before they got their Q3 first installment of $12 million (of a total $34 million) from the NIH.

Just Q2&#39;s 26.1 plus 12 = 38.1 without considering labs reopening, multiple Covid test clients during Q3 (both for their own test and their equipment processing others&#39; tests).  So expect a HUGE &quot;beat&quot;."

It’s my wife’s birthday tomorrow. Last week I asked her what she wanted as a gift. She said give me something with diamonds. So I decided to give her a pack of playing cards

Because it was my brothers birthday our mom decided to do something special. She called his fraternity house and said she wanted to bring a cake. The kid who took the call was very excited. He said wow that would be great. The next day she drove to the fraternity and rang the doorbell. The same kid answered the door and when he saw the cake his face was sad. He said I am very disappointed I thought you said KEG

Same positive results from the OWS funded NHP study, same FDA approval for first human dosing, great preliminary results from the hamster study. The Vaast platform is still a revolutionary positive. The NYT article is months old and all you have to do is read the PR from June to see the first sentence clearly states that the company had been chosen to participate in the OWS FUNDED NON-PRIMATE STUDY and thankfully it looks like they received very positive results from it.  I still think in the long run the press attention will bring new investors who take time to check out the ticker. Good luck trading all and hopefully when the PR about the full NHP data is released, all eyes will be on $VXRT.   Staying calm and I might actually go fishing 🎣 today and let the dust settle."

Retail Is already mostly in the red here with no more cash to throw at this. Games will be played. For me, this is a hold until another hot spot is announced or until Nov 6th- If nothing comes from Earnings I am out temporarily. However, remember the tute ownership here. HamburgerHumper would like you to believe that institutional owner ship doesn&#39;t matter- but it absolutely does. They will run CIRCLES around FLDM retail traders all day. 

Not an easy stock to day trade, so don&#39;t suggest it. For me, it&#39;s a simple semi long swing into earnings and that&#39;s all that matters in the near term. 

Lastly, if this closes above 7.20, you should be happy. It&#39;s not about the price over the last 30 days but 3mos-52weeks.

QCOM – alerted at the break of 121 as it gapped nicely to 130$. Could see a pull back and it is quite risky to play earnings on this. If this shoes a bad er or sentiment  becomes bearish this can test $120 after the er report. However, if earnings is perceived bullish this can gap to $140. Risky play off the charts honestly. Best to buy afterwards. 

SNAP- earnings is approaching if this stays above $26 it is still a bullish trend. Look for a push to $30+ if earnings are great for snap. Possibly even 32-35 as well. Could consolidate around 27-28 range until the er. So it is best to monitor the risk and go further out. 

TGT- support is coming up strongly around sma support of 160. This can see a possible upward momentum to $170 which is the upper trendline resistance. With a bullish market condition I can see touching 170 this week. If there is a pull back due to the market then watch the critical level at 160.

Their second largest position doesn&#39;t have nearly as many ST watchers and one you should watch: NVO
These are their top 50 positions:
https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Renaissance+Technologies

These are two smaller holdings that Renaissance carries that I suggest to watch. I took a position last week AIH and week before RVP. Obviously there is some risk associated with Chinese holdings (AIH) but worth noting the technical breakout and who is backing them:

Renaissance owns:
$AIH 3.13% of the company. Broke above the 200 SMA this week and the 20 and 50 the week before. Announced share buyback.
$RVP 4.67% of company and their top institutional investor by more than 2 fold. Chart looking primed as it broke above the 50 this month. High short interest should squeeze this up."

“We will have lots of conversations with industry and stakeholder engagement, and that’ll help us in our work on digital currencies and cross-border payments,” Powell said in an International Monetary Fund panel.
Powell said private sector initiatives like Facebook’s Libra project have accelerated central banks’ interest in setting up their own digital currencies.

But Powell cautioned that the Fed faces “difficult policy and operational questions,” such as the monetary policy implications of a digital dollar. Powell also listed illicit activity and cyber attacks as risks.
“I actually do think this is one of those issues where it&#39;s more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first,” Powell said."

TheFlyontheWall.com - Live News Feed
Posted 19-Oct-2020 at 09:50 am EST

After the Trump Administration announced on Friday that Fluidigm&#39;s saliva-based test will be used to support federal surge testing for COVID-19 in Texas, Piper Sandler analyst Steven Mah said he believes test volumes &quot;will be nominal at the beginning,&quot; but could become meaningful if a large second wave occurs. However, Mah views this as &quot;another validation of Fluidigm&#39;s technology for high-throughput COVID-19 testing&quot; and would be a buyer of the stock given the recent pullback. Mah has an Overweight rating and $12 price target on Fluidigm shares."

Bullish,$TACO Loading a bunch a cheap shares here!
Bullish,$TACO - Maybe it&#39;s going to wait for Taco Tuesday to pop....lol...
Bullish,$TACO this has to bounce today! Purely on a technical level!
Bullish,"$TACO There are four ways to improve shareholder value, invest the money in new restaurants/raise revenue, share buy backs, reduce debt or dividends. For whatever reason, Del Taco chose to buy back $10&#39;s of millions in stock and reduce debt by $10&#39;s of millions. They also optimized their company owned portfolio and shed unprofitable stores. Meanwhile, between 2016 and now, stock has traded above $14 like five different times.  Company more profitable than ever. Less stock in the float, less debt and its trading near all time lows?  So don&#39;t look at the flat revenue and make a silly conclusion like they didn&#39;t have money to open stores, they make plenty of money.  Buy and hold. Fundamentals will run anyone over trying to stop what&#39;s inevitable."

Bullish,$TACO happy to be back in. Honestly hoping she opens neat up again so I can have one more loading opportunity because she can only be suppressed so long before she grows 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Bullish,"$TACO There is no money left to be made short.  3.5 million shares gobbled up in the $8&#39;s, that&#39;s the floor. Analysts have it at $12-$13 a share. There is just no justification to suppress this valuation given the business model and how perfectly suited it is for the times. It will go to $10-$12 in the months ahead. Look at the whole history chart...that&#39;s the range and this company has never been better positioned for the world than it is right now."

US Fed Government:  
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that the Fed is open to collaborating with the private sector on a possible digital U.S. dollar, but reiterated that the central bank has not committed to actually launching one.
“We will have lots of conversations with industry and stakeholder engagement, and that’ll help us in our work on digital currencies and cross-border payments,” Powell said in an International Monetary Fund panel.
Powell said private sector initiatives like Facebook’s Libra project have accelerated central banks’ interest in setting up their own digital currencies.

But Powell cautioned that the Fed faces “difficult policy and operational questions,” such as the monetary policy implications of a digital dollar. Powell also listed illicit activity and cyber attacks as risks.

Bullish,"$MAXR the more I think about it, I&#39;m not sure I want this stock to get bought out. We could get instant gains with a buyout. But the potential for this company in the next decade could far surpass the gains of a buyout today. Market cap is only 1.8 billion, IMO that&#39;s peanuts when you have companies like $spce at over 5B"
Bullish,"$MAXR Maxar circa 2017, Digitalglobe acquisition debt is high as Legion build is just beginning. Stock price $60 with a pending $600M cash burn to build Legion over the next few years.

Maxar today, Legion on track to launch in a few months and facilitate growth in a over subscribed earth intelligence unit. Vricon 3D rendering added as a wholely owned Maxar asset. NASA Artemis contract for power and propulsion entering growth phase as Mars aspersions and 5G satellites fuel SSL resurgence. Stock price $30

So if the company was worth $60 in 2017 how is it worth $30 on the eve of a massive growth cycle? As the first Legion satellite comes online this stock could easily enter the 3 digit club and still have a forward PE under 10. Even at $100, $6.1B Marketcap it would be 1/3 the PS of $IRDM even though it has about 10x the technology wuth robotics and vertically integrated manufacturing. What&#39;s harder imaging 25cm at 15x Per day or sending a text message via satellite? Cheap vs peers."
Bullish,$MAXR patients it will eventually break. This is just what maxr does it gets stuck at a level for awhile then moves up. I&#39;ve thought about trying to play the buy sell game but usually end up missing the leg up and regret not holding. This stock is heading back to $80.

The way I see this is similar to GPOR movement last week. We see a dip, think it’s a great opportunity, buy it. Then another dip comes, and another. It’s a cycle. I believe that once we hit a certain point the only way is up. There is no news or explanation to the drop in price. You can say people don’t trust Fisker blah blah, but why would the sell off happen now? It doesn’t add up."

Mark Bedwell looking great after over 1 year and half AFTER having recieved nurown. This completely shatters the bear case regarding phase 2, as the multidose can last very long for the right biomarker (based on public nurown recipients it looks like 15% minimum to a potential over 30% of ALS patients!)
https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/local-man-speaks-out-a-year-after-receiving-stem-cell-als-treatment/527-3c0b7b25-cbae-4ea6-b8b8-0df160369d2d"
Bullish,"$BCLI We expect BCLI are acquiring commercilsation and production pipelines of the highest calibre.

What are Bcli offering ?...what can they offer ?....shares and future sales cut.

To agree such a deal the company would need what ?.... supreme confidence in Nurown and in Bcli. That&#39;s it."
Bullish,"$BCLI Clearly David Setboun has secured Global commercialisation / production deals. A reminder that his 250k shares are tied to securing the deal within 10 days of unblinding. 

A reminder also that Bcli confirmed they intend to be good to go to treat the maximum number of patients from the off. While not specific, this is good news and exudes confidence.

Now add to this BCLi informing that Patients from anywhere on planet earth can come to the US for treatment. 450,000 pALS.

Analysts will best value the company once we know how much Nurown will cost. I assume around 200k based in Chaims previous comments and Radicava apparently costing around 148k pa. 

Being a global deal, I forsee a seriously big named partner or two. What that does to the SP is sure to create volatility with many selling after read-out but that also being the signal for Tutes to build.

Then !...so many other indications lined up that the value of the company will be staggering."
Bullish,"$BCLI Good morning all, especially to new investors. The longs try and keep this board informative and factual. Many will help with pointers on DD. I&#39;ll provide some here.

Be advised that with data read-out probably less than 40 days away, you will see negative comments from bears and Chaim haters, but they cannot point to even 1 fact connected to the trial which suggests failure is possible.
Do not have stop losses on, bears can see this."

Bullish,"$WKHS Part 3.  I always felt like USPS wanted a big name and clout behind this contract.  In my opinion, that big name has always been GM.  I feel the date was pushed back for a couple of reasons: 1)Wkhs had to get access to more capital, that happened this week. 2) I feel that the merger between. Workhorse and Lordstown/GM is the last thing that has to happen before the contract can be awarded.  That can happen as soon as Oct 22.  3) After Oct 22, say Oct 25/26 a subsequent merger between wkhs/LT/GM can be announced.  This gives usps what it wants and give Trump a chance to stand in Lordstown and take credit for it.  He did tell the layed off GM employees &quot;dont sell your house&quot;.  He can claim a promise kept in a crucial state when he award 70% of contract (for cities n suburbs in warm climates to wkhs).  He then announces 30% to Ford (for rural routes and colder climates) to Ford/Oshkosh to gain votes in Michigan ($F ) and Wisconsin ($OSK ).  Minda and Votes in 3 key states changed."

Otherwise, gotta hold tight till we see some results of the stim &amp; the election. Cramer might help a bit in promoting the Fisker but the Merger itself might not be of a great help.

Once enough supply is available globally, it will be granted formal approval by the FDA and EMA for routine use in asymptomatic and mildly ill patients - much like Tamiflu is used. At $1000 a treatment (in volume) globally, the revenue for $GILD is substantial.  Excellent growth play here with a healthy dividend while you wait.

&quot;Weyland acquired Push to support the launch of its CreateApp mCommerce and mobile fintech solutions in North America, as well as additional eCommerce products and services globally. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in the first full calendar quarter as part of Weyland.&quot;

&quot;Weyland reported last fall trailing 12-month recurring revenues of more than $32 million, with Push recently reporting that it has sustained a significant return to growth in the second half of 2019, ending the year at a nearly $12 million annual run-rate, up more than 300% since mid-year.&quot;&quot;

&quot;CreateApp requires literally no technical understanding or skills in app design for anyone to build a full-featured custom app in less than two hours. CreateApp is a Shopify-like solution for mobile that enables businesses and brands to establish a mCommerce presence in an intuitive, do-it-yourself fashion.&quot;

CSX- Still in a bullish trend if it trades above $80. This could see 82-83 near term and could be a sleeper play that you can monitor. Doesn’t have much volume in options but you can snag one or two for a good gain if it does breakout. Earnings this week. 

FCX- trading within the wedge still and earnings will either take it pass the top trend resistance at 18$ or more or break down the wedge which can potentially hit  mid low 16s.  This could be a strong watch for all precious metal plays. Maybe a potential record earnings beat can push this to the $20 target I set from two months ago.

No Marvel movie has done under 850 million dollars in since 2017, and the only one it did was Logan because it was rated R and parents didnt take their youngest kids, and teenagers couldnt go see it without an adult.

Every movie they made in 2019 did over 1 BILLION dollars with Avengers Endgame earning almost THREE BILLION...

Disney is a GIANT among ants people. $125 is a JOKE. Its a $1000 stock, and I&#39;m not just spouting. $NFLX is over $500 and has zero merchandise sales opportunities. Has no hotel franchise. Has no golf course(s)... has no theme parks... has no tangable value for licensing (disney could license out spider man to sony for example)

Nobody should be paying to do a job by the hours, unless you are a lawyer. The gig (over 40 pages of work/drawing)  that is been done for us at the moment on fiverr.com will cost us $600.... on upwork.com , they want us to pay over $4k. Most of upwork vendors  in engineering are American, while Fiverr.com are mostly international. Will you pay a contractor to build your deck or a house by the hours...I don&#39;t think so. upwork.com still have room to grow when they start advertising to international vendors.... fiverr.com is doing great and have nothing to add to their model.

Bullish,$FANG why she down ???
Bullish,$FANG I actually have a good feeling this week for oil stocks
Bullish,$FANG BUY
Bullish,$FANG they want you to sell keep on buying and I promise you will double your money in 2021
Bullish,"$FANG this is a discount price. I know oil is struggling but how many times have you seen negative stuff about a stock and then a month or two later it pops and everyone forgets about all the bad stuff they said. I’m not saying this will hit the 80s any time soon but I know this company well and it could easily end up at 45-55 by spring. Hence why I bought a bunch of call for then. EV may be the future but the technology is far from perfect... oil still runs the world! It’s funny that a few month of shut down and people forget. When things get back to normal, I will be an oil fat pig. I’m loading the fuck up!"
Bullish,"$FANG my average is 45$, my price target is 87$"
Bullish,"$FANG Anyone who has held this stock for more then few months, knows how frustrating and confusing the ups and downs are. So why bother? the profit of course, but It is a gamble, a very real gamble. All oil is down, but......If this country can began to pull itself together in the next 3-6 months that will change.  
 
In terms of survival, Diamondback is at the top of most lists I have encountered  of &quot;Oil companies most likely to outlast the Pandemic&quot;.  
A bit of research in the company, and trust in a return to a form of normal within a year, keeps me in the DB game."
Bullish,"$FANG This is going to pop in 2 weeks or so, done my research on this puppy. 
If you haven’t done proper research then you need to.
I never touch this market during tough times it’s often hit the hardest.
But expect a 60-75% jump after ER.
Loads of cash in the bank, production costs very low.
I’ll be taking profits and leaving but until then top up on dips my average 29.44."

I&#39;ve never seen such before; multiple relatively new technologies are all about to peak simultaneously.  So the market will definitely continue to surge and eventually will skyrocket sometime in 2021, so I&#39;ve been telling my fellows that we have a golden opportunity to buy, many lucky ones bought already months ago, good luck to the rest the opportunity is fading away and will probably go away completely in the early months of 2021

If you read up on people like Stankey, they are not businessman, they are bureaucrats/politiceans. The guy has been at the same company his whole life and gotten to the top and we all know how that happens (and it&#39;s not about being brilliant). 
With the amount of money ATT prints every month and with record low rates, debt is not a bad thing and can even be a hedge against inflation. The biggest and the only problem is the outdated management. Activist investors need to step in with some creative solutions. 
It&#39;s clear what the trigger for the share jump would be, now let&#39;s make it happen."

In the initial MAGE A4 trial in synovial sarcoma  7/ 14 patients demonstrated a partial response.  Both NY-ESO and MAGE A4  are progressing in phase 2 trials and we should hear more about these in the next month.

Fellow bulls: 
I have considered moving half of my STNG position to ASC. I cannot overstate my love of how Howard Marks has a large position in ASC. Is there a point or are they just gonna move together anyway. I suppose it would reduce company specific risk. For me, Marks being in ASC vs. STNG president buying options like a degen means it would reduce that company specific risk significantly. Thoughts?"

Bullish,"$OSTK Long term, I am extremely bullish on this. But investors should be careful. 

If the stimulus passes, this will likely see rise back to $80 this week. 
If the stimulus does not, $65 is entirely possible. 
Confident earnings will produce over $100+, but that’s with caveat that a stimulus has passed before then. 

Either way, between the election and the economy moving into an insolvency phase, the entire market is bound to face more volatility."

Bullish,"$BXP i&#39;m loading up on BXP for multiple reasons. One is that they closed down the &quot;top of the hub&quot; at the prudential building and are &quot;  planning an exciting new design for an observatory at Prudential Center that will provide a world-class visitor experience for visitors to Boston.” This will become a BIG tourist attraction for anyone that visits Boston, similar to the Rockefeller center in NYC. Rather than getting rental income from &quot;the top of the hub&quot;, Boston properties will be getting income from tourists which will be substantially higher than the rent they were previously getting, IMO. Another reason why I&#39;m loading up on $O as well as BXP is because a lot of individual REITs sold off earlier this year and have not yet recovered. The rise in COVID-19 cases and the risk of further lockdowns are negatively impacting the market sentiment of REITs. The last time REITs were so cheap, was back in 2008-2009, and they nearly tripled in the following two years."

If I ever saw a ridiculous valuation hit based on an &quot;earnings miss,&quot; this JBHT drop is amongst the dumbest...

Underlying the quarter is a recovering economy, retail sales and the need for transport services... and here is the only part of the press release that needs my attention:

&quot;Volumes in the quarter were heavily constrained by rail congestion and service issues stemming from a large and sudden increase in demand and intermittent labor challenges in both the rail and truck networks.&quot;

JBHT is a well run company, and they will make the logistics adjustments they need to handle the &quot;LARGE AND SUDDEN INCREASE IN DEMAND&quot; -- with a certain increase in revnues, Gross margin, operating income, EBITDA and FCF...

Bullish,"$HCAC For all the nay-sayers about the subscription model, put this in perspective.

*** About a quarter of all new cars are leased.
*** 2019 had 4.3 million leases, with an average payment of $487/month.
*** Average insurance is $129/month.
*** The lease cost + insurance = $616/month for a traditional car, let alone an EV. This vehicle is set to lease around $600-$650/month, which includes DMV costs (and time), charge credits, ability to easily sublease out to others (Turo, be scared) and more.

This will be wildly popular when it&#39;s out. Canoo carved its niche, and knows its market well.

The subscription can be securitized and sold off to investors. Rather than selling the car off to consumers, they are selling it to investors via the security, and taking it off their balance sheet.

Super-bullish, especially when its 1% away from the floor, and unlimited upside. Commons ($HCAC) will be $25 by year end post merger. Warrants ($HCACW) will be ten-baggers.

Bullish,"$KODK Jim Continenza defended his company&#39;s handling of a halted $765 million U.S. loan at the WSJ Tech Live conference on Monday.

Mr. Continenza said Kodak would continue to proceed making drug ingredients, which the company had already started before it began talks with the U.S. government earlier this year for the loan, which was meant to help the company make the transition amid the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Continenza declined to comment on the status of the U.S. loan, which the agency involved put on hold soon after announcing it.

At the conference, Mr. Continenza said the company did its best to handle the situation, though he conceded his company has been understaffed."

Overall will take some time to mend, but not seeing the short incentive now from a 35%+ drop from ATH&#39;s. who knows if there is more downside from here as u can never truly be 100% certain, but if u put a gun to my head and said &quot;choose now&quot; logic dictates that odds favor upside. Of course this is barring no insane outside news headlines that changes the catalyst. Good luck"

Bullish,"$NIO $NKE $PG 

NIO- has been exploding lately and I believe the max downside would be 25 range. . I would monitor the pull back near the 25-26 range. However, the 27 range can be a possible bounce play on a dip. If this breaks 30$ before a pull back then it can gap up nicely. 

NKE- lovely pattern and still trading near the sma 20 support in the ascending wedge pattern. I can see this a good potential bounce play off sma support and trending upward to the trendline resistance and gap fill. I can see this 130-134$ in the near term and mid term $140 gap fill is possible. 

PG- close to the breakout and it tested the trendline resistance at 145. If you are wanting to play for the breakout you can, as it can gap to 150. However, earning reports are near for this stock. I am thinking a huge er beat but I could be wrong. If this can consolidate above 145 with a nice er beat this can gap up to 150 then even 155-160 continuation."

Zoom released an impressive set of earnings for its second quarter, reaffirming that it&#39;s still on a stunning growth path. Revenue jumped more than threefold year over year to $663.5 million, while net income catapulted from $5 million to $185 million. More businesses are shifting their operations to include telecommuting as part of the new normal, and Zoom is a direct beneficiary.
The company is also building a robust customer base that can contribute recurring revenue. The number of large customers (those contributing more than $100,000 in trailing-12-month revenue) was up 112% year over year. Zoom also saw a more than fourfold growth in smaller businesses to over 370,000 during the quarter."

 “President Donald Trump is pushing for a deal, and the White House is cautiously optimistic, but the sell-off in stocks is a sign that investors don’t believe that there’s enough political support in Congress to support a new package.    The only alternative for Trump is a quick win with a smaller stimulus package, but that’s also unlikely to receive Democratic support. There will be a stand-alone vote on more Paycheck Protection funds on Tuesday followed by a vote on a skinny $500-billion stimulus bill on Wednesday. If nothing happens by end of day Tuesday, stocks could fall sharply, leading to broad-based risk aversion in the forex market.”"

Also, this stock has been handcuffed by “shorts”. Volume is very low and I am puzzled at what I see. There is no way that we should be trading at this range unless there is something that we don’t know.
1. Did Buckley resign or was he forced? They say there was no cause.
2. Why did someone sell over 40 million shares for a discounted price at $9.50-$9.70?
3. Why are earnings this year after Election Day in the USA? 

Something does not feel right but that’s my own opinion. You need to do your dad. I hold 25,000 shares and will cash out at $8 if this drops. I just added 5000 last week.

Bullish,"$ACI Wall Street analysts have a consensus price target for the stock at $19.67, which means that the shares’ value could jump 36.5% from current levels. The projected low price target is $15 while the price target rests at a high of $26. In that case, then, we find that the current price level is +80.43% off the targeted high while a plunge would see the stock lose 4.09% from current levels.  We’re below the projected low target of $15. This is ridiculously cheap even by analysts estimates"
